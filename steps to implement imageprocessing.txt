🚀 Steps to Implement Image Pixelation (AWS Serverless)
🧩 Step 1: Define Your Goal
Build an Image Pixelator that:

✅ Uploads image via frontend

✅ Automatically pixelates it after upload

✅ Stores pixelated image in S3

✅ Serves it back to user via CloudFront

✅ No servers to maintain (fully serverless)

🧩 Step 2: Setup AWS Infrastructure
1. Create S3 Bucket
Bucket 1: original-images-bucket (for original uploads)

Bucket 2: processed-images-bucket (for pixelated images)

✅ Enable event notifications in original-images-bucket:

Trigger Lambda when a new image is uploaded

2. Setup IAM Role for Lambda
✅ Give permissions:

S3 read/write access

CloudWatch logs

(Optional) SNS if you want notifications

3. Create CloudFront Distribution
✅ Point to processed-images-bucket for fast image delivery globally.

🧩 Step 3: Develop Lambda Function (Python)
Lambda will:

Receive trigger from S3 when an image is uploaded

Download the image to /tmp/

Use Python Pillow library to pixelate the image:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pillow -t ./package
Resize image down (low resolution), then resize back up (pixelation effect).

Upload pixelated image to processed-images-bucket.

✅ Sample Pixelation Code (Python):

python
Copy
Edit
from PIL import Image
import boto3
import os

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def pixelate(image_path, output_path, pixel_size=10):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img = img.convert('RGB')
    img_small = img.resize(
        (img.size[0]//pixel_size, img.size[1]//pixel_size),
        resample=Image.NEAREST
    )
    result = img_small.resize(img.size, Image.NEAREST)
    result.save(output_path)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    download_path = f'/tmp/{object_key}'
    upload_key = f'pixelated-{object_key}'
    upload_path = f'/tmp/{upload_key}'

    s3.download_file(bucket_name, object_key, download_path)
    pixelate(download_path, upload_path, pixel_size=10)
    s3.upload_file(upload_path, 'processed-images-bucket', upload_key)
    
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'Pixelation complete'}
✅ Deploy this Lambda

Attach correct IAM role

Set correct timeout (recommend 30–60 seconds)

🧩 Step 4: Setup Frontend (Optional but Recommended)
Build a simple React.js / HTML interface:

Upload image button (connect to S3)

Option to adjust pixelation intensity (optional feature)

Display pixelated image from CloudFront URL

Use S3 pre-signed URLs for upload.

🧩 Step 5: Test End-to-End ✅
Upload an image via frontend or directly to S3 bucket

Lambda should automatically pixelate the image

Check processed-images-bucket

Access pixelated image via CloudFront link

🧩 Step 6: Optimize & Improve
✅ Optional improvements:

Add API Gateway for direct Lambda trigger

Add SNS or SQS for notifications

Add CloudWatch monitoring

Allow custom pixel size via S3 metadata

Auto-delete original image (for privacy use cases)
